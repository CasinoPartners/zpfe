      problem as soon as reasonably practicable. Where such problems cause a
      game to be interrupted in circumstances where it cannot be restarted from
      exactly the same position without any detriment to You or other players,
      we will take all reasonable steps to treat You in a fair manner (which may
      include reinstating the balance on Your Account to the position existing
      following completion of the last bet or game logged on the Operator’s
      server immediately prior to the occurrence of the problem).

    <p>
      1. &nbsp; &nbsp; 19.1 The Website uses ‘cookies’ to track Your use of the
      internet and to assist the functionality of the Website. A cookie is a
      small file of text which is downloaded onto Your Access Device when You
      access the Website and it allows us to recognise when You come back to the
      Website. We use cookies for the operation of the Website, including (for
      example) to allow You to remain logged in as You browse between, and use
      Your Account to bet on or play games on, different parts of the Website.
      We also use cookies for our own analytical purposes so that we can
      identify where customers have encountered technical problems on the
      Website, and therefore help us improve our customers’ experience.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>20. &nbsp; &nbsp;COMPLAINTS AND NOTICES</p>

    <p>
      1. &nbsp; &nbsp; 20.1.1 A game which You have played using the Services
      will be considered more than twelve weeks after the date on which the
      relevant transaction or game play took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Should You wish to make a complaint regarding the
      Services, as a first step You should, as soon as reasonably practicable,
      contact Customer Services about Your complaint, which will be escalated as
      necessary within our Customer Services team until resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If You have a complaint you can email customer
      support on support@{{siteDomain}}
    </p>
    <p>
      4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;t will use best efforts to resolve a
      reported matter promptly.

      details of the query. We will review any queried or disputed transactions.
      Our judgement is final.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. &nbsp; &nbsp; If there is a dispute arising from the Terms of Use which
      cannot be resolved by Customer Services having been escalated in
      accordance with paragraph 25.2, You can request that the matter be
      addressed by a manager or supervisor. We will endeavour to resolve the
      matter to your satisfaction either immediately or by contacting You
      subsequently.

    <p>
      7. &nbsp; &nbsp; You acknowledge that our random number generator will
      determine the outcome of the games played through the Services and You
      accept the outcomes of all such games. You further agree that in the
      unlikely event of a disagreement between the result that appears on Your
      screen and the game server used by the Operator, the result that appears
      on the game server will prevail, and You acknowledge and agree that our
      records will be the final authority in determining the terms and
      circumstances of Your participation in the relevant online gaming activity
      and the results of this participation.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. &nbsp; &nbsp; When we wish to contact You, we may do so using any of
      Your Contact Details. Notices will be deemed to have been properly served
      and received by You immediately after an email is sent or after we have
      communicated with You directly by phone (including where we leave You a
      voicemail), or three days after the date of posting of any letter. In
      proving the service of any notice, it will be sufficient to prove, in the
      case of a letter, that such letter was properly addressed, stamped and
      placed in the post; in the case of an email, that such email was sent to
      the specified email address (if any) in Your Contact Details at the time
      that any such email was sent.

      sublicense or pledge the Terms of Use (an “assignment”), in whole or in
      part, to any person without notice to You, provided that any such
      assignment will be on the same terms or terms that are no less
      advantageous to You.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. &nbsp; &nbsp; You may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer in
      any manner whatsoever any of Your rights or obligations under the Terms of

      including (without limitation) any telecommunications network failures,
      power failures, failures in third party computer (or other) equipment,
      fire, lightning, explosion, flood, severe weather, industrial disputes or

    </p>
    <p>
      2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Our performance is deemed to be suspended for the period
      that the Force Majeure Event continues, and we will have an extension of
      time for performance for the duration of that period. We will use our
      reasonable endeavours to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to
      find a solution by which our obligations may be performed despite the
      Force Majeure Event.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>23. &nbsp; &nbsp;WAIVER</p>
    <p>
      1. &nbsp; &nbsp; If we fail to insist upon strict performance of any of
      Your obligations or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or remedies
      to which we are entitled, this shall not constitute a waiver of such
      rights or remedies and shall not relieve You from compliance with such
      obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. &nbsp; &nbsp; A waiver by us of any default shall not constitute a
      waiver of any subsequent default.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. &nbsp; &nbsp; No waiver by us of any of the provisions of the Terms of
      Use shall be effective unless it is expressly stated to be a waiver and is

      and Notices) above.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>24. &nbsp; &nbsp;SEVERABILITY</p>
    <p>
      1. &nbsp; &nbsp; If any of the Terms of Use are determined by any
      competent authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any
      extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed
      from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions which will continue to
      be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In such cases, the part deemed invalid or
      unenforceable shall be amended in a manner consistent with the applicable
      law to reflect, as closely as possible, the Operator’s original intent.

      fraudulently) and the other party’s only remedy shall be for breach of
      contract as provided in the Terms of Use.

      permission (license for betting or organizing gaming) to place bets and
      for betting organizations.The User should note that if the placement of
      bets or participation in multiplayer poker and games such as lotteries is
      prohibited or permitted only under certain conditions, which are not

    <p>40. &nbsp; &nbsp;SPORTSBOOK RULES</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1. Betting rules</p>
    <p>
      1.1 The betting company accepts bets on the outcome of sporting and other
      events with a deliberately unknown result, including the use of
      telecommunication networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.2 Every time downloading the client’s application, regardless of the use
      of the media resource (via Internet or mobile services), by opening an
      account and using an existing account, betting or participating in any
      games, taking any prize, the client confirms his agreement with the
      current version of the Rules and the obligation to act in accordance with
      these Rules.Anytime a user downloads the client, registers an account,
      uses an existing account, bets on any games, takes any winnings, etc.,
      this signifies the User’s agreement and obligation to act in accordance
      with the current rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.3&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;has the right to make any changes and additions to
      the rules set forth herein, the provisions and procedures of payments
      without an individual prior written notice. Users are notified about this
      with appropriate announcements. The conditions of previously staked
      (placed) bets remain unchanged, and bets which are accepted are subject to
      the posted rules at the time of acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;reserves the right to refuse service to any person
      without disclosing the reason(s).
    </p>
    <p>2. Glossary</p>
    <p>2.1 Basic terms accepted in this edition of the rules:</p>
    <p>“Single”&nbsp;– a bet on a single event;</p>
    <p>
      “Express”&nbsp;– this is a bet on the outcome of several different events
      simultaneously. When you place a bet on the outcome of two or more events
      (for example, two different football matches), you can unite them in
      “Express”. To win an express bet it is necessary for you to not have any
      failed predictions (losses) on any of the outcomes which are included in
      the Express. Loss on one of the outcomes of an express bet means loss
      throughout the entire bet. Winnings of the express bets is equal the
      product of the bet amount at the coefficients of played outcomes included
      in the express (if on one of the bets included in the express occurs a
      return, then the coefficient on it equals to 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      “System”&nbsp;– a set of “express bets” of a particular set of events.
      Each combination of the system is calculated as a separate express bet. To
      win in the system it is sufficient that the indicated number of
      predictions of the total number be correct (it is defined by name, that
      is, for example, in the system “3 of 4″ it is necessary that 3 of the 4
      predictions prove correct, for “5 of 7″ it is necessary properly to
      predict the outcome of the five events of 7 options, etc.). It must be
      taken into account that because of the fact that only a part of the total
      bet amount is specified on each of the express of the system bet
      (proportional to the number of options) then the winnings by such a system
      bet will be less than the possible general winnings by the express bet. In
      some cases, when not all outcomes are predicted, the amount of winnings
      may be less than the amount of the bet, but in contrast to express bets, a
      part of the amount will be offset on account of correctly predicted
      outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Chain”&nbsp;– bet which is a combination of “single” bets including
      events independent from each other. The sum of single bet of chain‘s each
      event is equal to the sum of chain. The client is given a chance to
      determine independently the order of the bets included in the chain and
      stake only on the first event of the chain. Thus the concept of “chain
      account” is imported. After the tournament of each single bet included in
      the chain the sum of that account is calculated. Initially it is equal to
      the sum of the first bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the sum on the chain account is less than its initial sum, the chain’s
      next event’s single bet is calculated by the account balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procedure of chain’s calculation depends on the order of bets
      mentioned in the given ticket but not on time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sum which remains on the account after calculation of all bets in the
      chain is a subject to payment.

    <p>
      If the sum on the chain account reaches zero – the chain breaks and is
      considered to be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Handicap”&nbsp;– the advantage or the leeway of the entrant of
      competition, expressed in goals (points/) sets, etc., which is provided by
      the bookmaker office to the entrant with bets on it. The result of the
      event subject to the handicap is determined in this way: the handicap
      given to the entrant is added to the corresponding result shown by the
      entrant in the competition. If the results thus obtained are in favor of
      the elected entrant, he is considered as a winner, and the bets on his win
      subject to the handicap win. Payments are carried out with the coefficient
      of winnings indicated in the description of bets. If the result is in
      favor of the opponent – the bets are lost. If the result subject to the
      handicap is a draw, then the coefficient of winnings under such a result
      will be equal to 1 (return of the bet);
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p>Team 1 Team 2 Handicap 1 Coef. 1 Handicap 2 Coef.2</p>
    <p>Inter Cagliari -1.5 2.25 +1.5 1.9</p>
    <p>
      1) Suppose you want to bet upon the win of Cagliari subject to handicap.
      The handicap betting on Cagliari (Handicap 2) is equal to “+1.5″. To win
      with the bet on the handicap “+1.5″ it is necessary that Cagliari will not
      lose by more than 1 goal, as handicap +1.5 will be added to goals from
      Cagliari. Let us analyze all the options:
    </p>
    <p>
      * A) Cagliari won or the teams drew or Cagliari lost by the difference of
      1 goal. For example, the final score is 2-1. Taking into account the
      handicap (+1.5) the result 2:2.5 in favor of Cagliari (the handicap of
      Inter when determining the result on the rates at Cagliari is not taken
      into account). The bets win.
    </p>
    <p>
      * B) Cagliari lost by more than 1 goal difference. For example, the final
      score is 2-0. Taking into account the handicap (+1.5) the result is 2:1.5
      in favor of Inter. In this case, the rates on winning of Cagliari taking
      into account the handicap (+1.5) lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Similarly, the following variants are possible when betting on a win
      for Inter taking into account the handicap “-1.5″:
    </p>
    <p>
      * a) Inter won having the advantage of two or more goals. For example, the
      final score is 3-0. Taking into account the handicap (- 1.5) the result is
      1.5:0 in favor of Inter. The bets win.
    </p>
    <p>
      * b) Inter won having the advantage of 1 goal, teams drew or Cagliari won.
      For example, the final score is 2-1. Taking into account the handicap
      -1.5, the result of the bets on Inter at handicap (-1.5) gives 0.5:1, in
      favor of Cagliari. In this case, the bets on Inter with the handicap -1.5
      lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Double bet of handicap is offered (Asian handicap). Bet on victory or
      total taking into account the handicap, which is the multiple of 0.25 (but
      not of 0.5). Such bets are calculated as 2 bets with the half of sum: with
      the same odd and “common handicaps” and “common totals” multiple of 0.5’s
      near-by common value. In case when the Asian handicap is included in
      parlay or system, it is calculated with that odd which would be in case of
      single bet. In case of winning of two common bets, the bet’s odd “O” is
      taken into account in the calculations. If one common bet is won and the
      other is a subject to refund, during the calculation is taken the odd
      (“O”+1)/2. If both common bets are lost, the whole bet considered lost.

    </p>
    <p>
      “Total”&nbsp;– the number of goals, pucks, points or the games, scored
      (thrown, gained or played) by an entrant or entrants of events.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p>
      Suppose the total of the soccer game is set (the amount of goals scored)
      equal to “4″, and a wagering is offered on the total at two outcomes: more
      or less of the given total.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the match is scored with a total of less than 4 goals (0-0, 1-0, 0-1,
      1-1, etc.), bets lower than “4″ win.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the match is scored with a total of more than 4 goals (4-1, 4-2, 3-2,
      etc.), bets lower than “4″ lose and bets more than “4″ win.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the match is scored with a total of exactly 4 goals (3-1, 4-0, 2-2,
      1-3, 0-4), all bets on more than “4″ and less than “4″ will be refunded.
    </p>
    <p>3. Policy of Bets</p>
    <p>
      3.1 The values of the parameters (including handicaps, totals) and
      coefficients of the events specified in the line of the current day may
      change after any bet, but conditions before bets are the same, except in
      cases of technical and obvious mistakes in the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.2 As an amount of bet only the amount confirmed and registered by the
      company is accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.3 The User is the only person who is responsible for the bet. Once a bet
      is made and its acceptance is confirmed, it cannot be changed or canceled
      by the User&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;does not provide any guarantees with
      respect to the “lost” or “double” bets made by customers. Please carefully
      check all the bets you have made.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.4 Loss of your password cannot be a reason for the withdrawal rates or
      cancellation of the request for payment of winnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.5 A bet is accepted as soon as it is confirmed by the company. All
      accepted bets are displayed in the “Bet History”. In some cases there may
      be a delay until a bet is listed in your history. In case of any dispute
      the time when the bet was registered in the system of the company is
      considered to be its true submission time. If the User did not receive any
      notification about the acceptance of bet, the rate is still considered to
      be accepted if it is displayed in the “Bet History.”
    </p>
    <p>
      3.6 Failures of communication or other technical failures in customer
      communications are not a reason for the cancellation of a bet if the bet
      has been registered in the server.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>4. Displaying Data</p>
    <p>
      4.1 The Company is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness and
      timeliness of the proposed information services, including data on the
      events of Live and mailing services.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;makes every effort to make the information on Live
      events (such as results, the time of a game and the statistics of teams
      /players) be correct. However, this information is displayed only for
      informational purposes.&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;is not responsible in case of
      any errors in this data.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.3&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;t &nbsp;is not responsible and does not accept any
      claims regarding the accuracy of the translation from foreign languages of
      team names and the names of the players.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.4 If in the indicated event/match more than one member with the same
      surname is present and during bet acceptance the full name of the athlete
      or other features identifying them uniquely have not been indicated, all
      bets are refundable.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.5 If in the name of the match or in the name of the position one or more
      entrants are indicated in the line incorrectly (except for errors in
      translation), that is if the other team/entrant of represented tournament
      is indicated instead of the necessary one, all the bets on that event are
      recognized as invalid and a return is made. Only&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;has
      the right to determine the events belonging to this category.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.6 In cases when the specific details of the team such as a particular
      age group (for example 18 years/to 21 years/youth teams), gender (women)
      or the status of the team (reserve) are not indicated in the line
      resulting in the marking of the other team in the line instead of the
      declared one, all bets on this match are refundable. In other cases when
      incomplete name or possible grammar errors are indicated in the line, all
      bets remain in force. If the gender of teams is not indicated in the line,
      it is considered that the gender of teams is male.&nbsp;In case women’s
      teams are participating in a match it is necessary to have a detailed
      indication about it in the line otherwise bets on this match are a subject
      to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.7 Date and time indicated in the line are the date and time of
      discontinuation of betsˈ acceptance on the event (except for Live events)
      and do not necessarily coincide with the date and time of the actual start
      of the event. The actual time of the event while counting the bets is
      considered as the time of the start of the event, which is determined
      based on the official documents of the organization conducting the
      competition, as well as the data of&nbsp;{{siteName}} .
    </p>
    <p>
      4.8 If the place of conducting a meeting is not indicated in the line, in
      the list of events the host of the field is indicated firstly, except for
      competitions of American types of sports. All the information contained in
      the “cap” to a particular sport, carries an ancillary character. Possible
      errors in the given information are not a ground for the return of bets.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.9 On acceptance of bets for Live Events there is a set delay, the value
      of which may vary depending on the sport, market, and other features, and
      it is determined exclusively by&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;for security and
      protection from subsequent bets.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.10 For clients convenience, taking into account the specificity of Live
      Events in which coefficients change very often a client can choose one of
      the following options: to “Accept all changes in the coefficients”,
      “Accept only marked-up bets” or “Do not accept bets if the coefficients
      change,” which determines respectively whether the bet is accepted if
      during the time of its arrangement the coefficient changed, at any changes
      of it, or just in the case when the changed bet exceeds the estimated
      coefficient of the bet of the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.11 Incorrectly indicated date of the conducted match is not a ground for
      cancellation of the bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.12 If the match began from the moment at which it was previously
      interrupted, and in the line that was not stipulated, the bets are
      refundable.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>5. Interlocking events and outcomes</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      5.1 In “express” and “system” bets it is forbidden to include different
      events that relate to the same match, not even the ones which are
      interdependent directly. If in such bets were included any events that
      relate to the given match, this bet is refundable, even if the computer
      program of accepting the bettings did not block this bet during its
      submission.&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;reserves the exclusive right to determine
      whether the events are connected.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      5.2 In the game on output-absence from the group in “express” and “system”
      bets it is allowed only to bet on one team from the given group. If in
      such bets qualify-not qualify of the teams from the same group were
      included then the given bets are refundable, even if the computer program
      accepting the bets did not block this bet during its
      submission.&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;reserves the unique right to decide
      whether to accept bets on the position of qualify or not qualify in
      “express”, “system” and in “single” bets.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>6. Obvious and technical errors</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      6.1 The Company is not responsible for errors in typing, transfer or
      counting of bets. In particular,&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;reserves the right to
      correct obvious errors made while entering information on betting
      coefficients and/or calculation of the amounts at the bets (for example,
      errors in the coefficients indicated in teams incorrectly, incorrectly
      indicated events, etc.), or declare invalid the corresponding bets even
      after completion of the event. In the cases of correcting obvious errors
      bets are returned. The most common types of technical errors are the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      6.1.1 Errors of input of coefficients – when the coefficient (or the
      setting of the handicap/total, etc.) is displayed without a separator
      (dot) or with any additional number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: instead of the coefficient 1.8, 18 is displayed, instead of 2, 23
      is displayed, instead of 3, 30 is displayed etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.1.2 “Mirror Errors” – when the coefficients for players are displayed in
      a diametrically opposite manner. In this case, the favorite of the game
      (including current favorite of live event) is displayed by a coefficient
      exceeding the coefficient of the outsider of the given event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. Instead
      of 1.2 and 4, 4and 1.2 is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.1.3 Writing errors – if all the coefficients are indicated correctly,
      however, teams are written in an incorrect order (usually occurs for
      events taking place on a neutral field).
    </p>
    <p>
      Meaning for the previous example: record: Basketball. Unicaja-Barcelona.
      The winner of the match. 1.2 and 4 instead of Basketball.
      Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. 1,2 and 4
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear indicators of obvious errors are: very large difference in the
      coefficients of&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;and other bookmakers, the coefficients
      that are nearly impossible to give in the current situation of the match.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right to determine whether or not an obvious or a technical error was
      made in any case belongs exclusively&nbsp;{{siteName}}.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;reserves the right to abolish the bets made on
      deliberately incorrect coefficients and obvious errors. The customer will
      be informed about changes in the balance immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;reserves the right to cancel the bets even after the
      end of the event if these bets are won by the User as a result of a
      technical failure or an obvious error.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.4 In cases when due to technical reasons the User’s bets were not
      provided with the necessary amount of funds in the account, the bets are
      considered as invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.5 In case of mistakenly having credited the means to the customer’s
      account the latter shall immediately notify&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;about the
      mistake. If due to an error a negative balance has been formed at the
      client, the betting company has the right to cancel the uncalculated bets
      despite the fact that they were made before the error occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.6 The Company reserves the right to oblige the User to liability for any
      damage caused to it if the user used a technical or administrative error
      intentionally when making a deposit and/or during the receipt of money on
      the account.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>7 Bets on credit</p>
    <p>
      7.1&nbsp;{{siteName}} &nbsp;does not accept any bets or provide services to
      customers on credit. All bets must be confirmed with funds existing in the
      account of the User.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>8. Late bets</p>
    <p>
      8.1 Bets placed after the start of the event, except the bets for Live
      Events, in all cases, are invalid and are returnable, and are excluded
      from the “express” and “system” bets. Any bet (including bets for Live
      Events) made on an event, the result of which is already known by the time
      of betting, is considered invalid and will be refunded.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.2 If the User wishes to challenge the time of the start of the event, he
      must provide an official document (or a link to the website of regulatory
      bodies of the given event) which confirms the actual time of the start of
      the match on which the given bet was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.3 While arising disputes regarding the time of the start of the event,
      if the official regulatory bodies of the appropriate tournament/event do
      not provide (or lack) such information, the information of&nbsp;{{siteName}}
      &nbsp;about the start time of the event is considered the only correct one
      while calculating the bets.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>9. Return</p>
    <p>
      9.1 If a “return” is declared about the bet, such bet is considered as won
      with the coefficient of 1. In case of “Single” bets this means that the
      User will get back the amount of money placed to this bet. In the case of
      “express” or “system” bets the total coefficient will be changed
      accordingly (in the event, where a return occurred, the coefficient will
      get the value 1, the coefficients on the remaining events will remain
      unchanged, and the final coefficient will be counted according to similar
      scheme; only the coefficient of the outcome on the event, on which was
      given a return – one of the factors (multipliers) of the final coefficient
      of “express” or “system” – will get the value 1).

      In case Finland and England won in the above mentioned games, and Croatia
      won by 2 goals advantage, and the given express plays, but when
      calculating the total coefficient there will be 1 instead of 1.7
      (coefficient of winning) and the final coefficient of the given express

      to the total of the bet and among the proposed outcomes of the given total
      bets there has not been the option equal … (the indicated number) of
      goals, a return is made. Similarly, for the individual totals, totals of
      the player, totals of cards/corners /removals, fouls and other parameters
      if the final value of the match and the proposed parameter of the total
      are equal a return is made.

    <p>10. Match-fixing</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      10.1 In case of possible interference in the match result and the
      formation of the coefficients for the match (including cases of suspicion
      in match-fixing),&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;&nbsp;reserves the right to suspend
      the payments on this event or to cancel the bets on this match, as well as
      hand over the information on relevant side to the appropriate authorities
      for further investigation and prevention of similar incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;reserves the right to suspend the payment of the
      rates and make a return on the rates to the event, if there are solid
      grounds to believe this match was negotiable. Such grounds may be based on
      the size, number and nature of the bets made by one or all of the possible
      methods of betting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision of the governing bodies of relevant federations and
      regulatory bodies are also taken into account. In such
      cases&nbsp;{{siteName}}&nbsp;t &nbsp;reserves the right to hand over the
      information on related party to the governing bodies for further
      investigation and preventing similar incidents.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>11. Neutral field</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      11.1 In cases when the match is transferred to a neutral field (NF) rates
      persist. They are refundable in cases when the match is transferred to the
      opponent’s field. In case of the play when the teams are from the same
      city and are transferred to another field, bets are valid and are not
      refundable. In international matches, the refund of bets is made only when
      the match transfers to the field of an opponent state.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>12. Interrupted events</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      12.1 An event is considered interrupted if there was no play for an
      indispensable amount of playing time specified according the rules of the
      company, even if the result at which the event was interrupted is later
      confirmed to be final.
    </p>
    <p>
      12.2 The matches consider to be taken place, if they have been
      interrupted, not finished in the time-frame specified in the points 6 and
      7 and if the played time is the following:

      Users have acted in collusion or as a syndicate, or suspicious bets have

        >The theoretical Return to Player “RTP” calculation is a theoretical
        calculation of the expected % of wagers that a specific game will return
        to player after an amount of plays (e.g 100,000,000 game plays.) While
        every single game play will be truly unpredictable and it will be
        possible to see all viable outcomes on a specific bet, the average
        return of a specific game in the long run will approach the theoretical
        RTP value. The RTP value is calculated via either a theoretical or
        simulated approach depending on the game type.</em
